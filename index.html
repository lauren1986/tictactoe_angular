          <h3>Instructions</h2>
          <p>Need a little pick-me-up? Take your mind off your own bullshit by engaging in a game of tic-tac-toe. Why you ask?</p>
            <ol>
              <li>It's distracting. Come on, admit it, you need to get outside of your own head right now.</li>
              <li>The layout, typography and colors of this game are incredibly calming. You can't deny it; plus it's 53&#37; backed by science.</li>
              <li>If you are smart enough to beat your opponent (aka, focus on something else besides your own
                  problems for two seconds), you'll get rewarded with a priceless piece of wisdom
                  that will solve all your woes. True story.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So what are you waiting for? Pick a partner and get playing!</p>

          <p class="little">PS&#58; If you are Player #2, you cannot be more awesome than #1. It's just a fact.</p>
